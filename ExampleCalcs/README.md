## Example calculations

In this Folder you will find a sample of the key calculations done for
the manuscript:“Inferring stability and persistence in the vaginal
microbiome: a stochastic model of ecological dynamics”

Authors: J.M. Ponciano, Larry J. Forney, Juan P. Gomez and Jacques
Ravel.

All the calculations are in the file StochasticStability.Rmd which is
knitted to the html file
[StochasticStability.html](https://jmponciano.github.io/StochasticMicrobiome/ExampleCalcs/StochasticStability.html).
